* Increase PHP Memory Limit

There is a common WordPress Memory Exhausted Error that users have seen when activating some plugin. You can increase the PHP Memory Limit through wp-config.php file. Simply paste the code below:

define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64M');

If you are on windows with IIS server .htaccess file will not work for you,
You should update this setting in php.ini file.

memory_limit = 64M

* Relationship between memory limit and scalability

It's important to understand that increasing the amount of memory each PHP process can use decreases the number of concurrent processes that can run. Concurrent processes are key to the maximum number of page requests you can serve at any given time.

For example, lets assume a server with 2 GB of memory free for PHP after accounting for other processes running on it (the OS, Apache, and so on).
